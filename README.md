# TNS-s_Aggro
A WoW Vanilla AddOn that warns the player when he's taking aggro by displaying a warning text and playing the default gun sound.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to WoW Vanilla's limitations, the warning will only display the ennemy's name **if and only if** the **PLAYER** is <ins>**TARGETING**</ins> that same **ENEMY**.
